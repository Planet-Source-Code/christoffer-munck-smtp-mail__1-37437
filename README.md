## SMTP mail


</div>

### Description

This is a SMTP mail, you can use this to send a mail. Use winsock control, but you don't need a form to use it, a simple reference to the winsock should be enough. The cool thing about this is that you can use it in you Active X or COM roject.

There are some things that could be improved, you cannot send attachments yet for example.

It would be nice if you give me som credit for this class if you use it...but you don't have to.

Please read documentation carefully. (it also gives you instrunctions how to reference the winsock control)
